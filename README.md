# Retrorama for ES-DE
This is a port of the beautiful retro theme by [lipebello](https://github.com/lipebello/es-theme-retrorama), originally made for the Retropie and then ported to Launchbox

I am totally new to EmulationStation theming so I used the [Colorful (Revisited) for ES-DE](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/colorful-revisited-es-de) as my
base.

This port is absolutely not perfect but works for my needs and I will try to update it if I notice bugs.
