# Retrorama for ES-DE

This is a port of the beautiful retro theme by [lipebello](https://github.com/lipebello/es-theme-retrorama), originally made for the Retropie and then ported to Launchbox.

It works with the latest theme engine (as of the time of writing this) of EmulationStation Desktop Edition: v2.2.1

I am totally new to EmulationStation theming so I used the [Colorful (Revisited) for ES-DE](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/colorful-revisited-es-de) as my
base. That said, I did perform some minor changes like the marquee displaying at the top, next to system logo instead from inside the description list. That allows the list to always be full size even if the marquee is missing.

I have yet to test the 16:10 ratio but I will since I plan on using this on my Legion Go. For the moment, the settings are the same for both 16:9 and 16:10

This port is absolutely not perfect but works for my needs and I will try to update it if I notice any bugs.
